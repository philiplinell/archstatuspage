I'm having an issue with my Arch Linux system (Kernel: {{ .Kernel }}).

I ran a system health check and found the following issues:

{{ range .Issues }}
 - {{ . }}
{{ end }}

Could you assist me in diagnosing these issues? I would appreciate step-by-step instructions on how to resolve each one, including any recommended commands or tools for further investigation.

Please ensure that your suggestions are practical and detailed, taking into account the specifics of Arch Linux.

Please think hard before you answer.
